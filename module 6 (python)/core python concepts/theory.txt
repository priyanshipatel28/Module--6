Understanding data types: integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets. 
 Python variables and memory allocation. 
 Python operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise. 
--->Understanding Data Types 
- Integer:Whole numbers, positive or negative.  
- Float: Numbers with decimal points.  
- String:Sequence of characters .  

---> Python Variables and Memory Allocation  
- Variables store data values and reference memory locations dynamically allocated during runtime.

---> Python Operators  
- Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations like +, -, *, //.  
- Comparison Operators: Compare values, e.g., ==, !=, <, >.  
- Logical Operators: Combine conditions using and, or, not.  
- Bitwise Operators: Perform bit-level operations like &, |, ^, ~.
