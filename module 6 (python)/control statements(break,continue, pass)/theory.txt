Understanding the role of break, continue, and pass in Python loops.

break:
Purpose: Exits the loop entirely, regardless of the condition.

One-liner to remember: break stops the loop completely.

continue:
Purpose: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

One-liner to remember: continue skips the rest of the current iteration.

pass:
Purpose: Acts as a placeholder; does nothing when executed.
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # Does nothing for i == 3
    else:
        print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 4
onr-lineer to remember : pass does nothing and is used as a placeholder.
